A simple video-to-slide converter application that aims to obtain slide images (or pdf) given slide or lecture videos.
<!-- This is highly useful when one wishes to have a video lecture(with or without animations) in the form of slides â€“ either a ppt or pdf. This project aims to build a robust application that can convert video lectures into corresponding slides using techniques such as basic frame differencing and statistical background subtraction models such as KNN or GMG. -->
