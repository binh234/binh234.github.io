Combine the strengths of different models including [Tag2Text](https://github.com/xinyu1205/Tag2Text), [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO), and [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) in order to build a very powerful pipeline which aims to detect and segment Anything with (or without) text inputs automatically.
