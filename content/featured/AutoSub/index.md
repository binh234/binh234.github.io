A fast and accurate automatic closed captioning system for video/audio. The project covers and addresses multiple problems including Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Inverse Text Normalization (ITN), and Automatic Capitalization and Punctuation (CaPu).

<!-- My Speech Recognition model based on Wav2Vec2 model and achieved 96% accuracy on the clean test set and 90% accuracy on the noise test set.
My CaPu model utilized pre-trained language model (BERT, RoBERTa, XLM-R, ...) and achieved 90% accuracy on the Capitalization task and 80% accuracy on the Punctuation task
I also contributed to the NeMo repository for Vietnamse ITN and got accepted -->
