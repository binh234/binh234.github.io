The project aimed to replicate the core functionality of YouTube, such as video searching, playing, and recommendations. 
I used ReactJS to build the frontend of the application, creating components such as the video player, search bar, and video recommendation section. To access the YouTube video data, I utilized the Rapid API to retrieve videos, recommendations, video/channel metadata, and comments as well.
