Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Viet Nam](https://hcmut.edu.vn/en) where I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering (2018-2022) with 87.6% aggregate.

I have experience in building end-to-end machine learning projects, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model selection and deployment.

In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest technologies, reading about best practices, and exploring new tools and techniques. I'm eager to collaborate with other AI developers and contribute to the development of innovative and impactful AI applications.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
